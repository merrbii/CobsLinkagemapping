Code as well as datasets used to analyze recombination rate variation and genome dynamics in _Cardiocondyla obscurior_.

The [bioinformatic_pipeline.md](main/bioinformatic_pipeline.md) markdown contains a description of our bioinformatic pipeline
The [mainFigures.Rmd](main/mainFigures.Rmd) R markdown contains code used to produce the main table and figures, based on data provided under the [datasets](main/datasets) folder.
